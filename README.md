# SNAKE-GAME
##Introduction
This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle and Time modules. 
The objective of the game is to control a snake and eat as many food items as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.
The snake grows longer every time it eats a food item, making the game progressively more challenging.
##Features
Simple and intuitive controls using arrow keys.
A growing snake that increases in length with each food item consumed.
A scoring system that keeps track of your high score.
Game over when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
A pause and resume feature using the 'P' key.
A restart option when the game is over.
